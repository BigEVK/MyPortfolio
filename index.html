        <!-- <div class="flex-row"> -->
        <p>I am a student at Rice University Coding Bootcamp and looking to start my career in Web Development.
            I have a background in programming from when I was a kid. My dad taught at a vocational school and
            programming was his forte. I would break games back when they ran on a Tandy 1000, TRS80, Apple,
            AppleII,
            Commodor, etc. There was a mainframe in a room the size of a small house.
            <br /><br />
            I have always had in iterest in programming and have watched the internet grow from the earliest of
            years.
            When I was in college I was on several BBSes, played online games, and did a little web design myself.
            I ventured in another direction in the following years, but curiosity has pulled me back in, and my how
            the web has grown. I look forward to being a part of shaping its future, as I am sure it will shape
            mine.
